The store is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, allowing customers to build a cart and checkout without registering an account. It also features a minimalist, fast-loading Bootstrap design. This can be left as default or modified to fit your needs.

The app uses cookies to store cart data and passes order information to the database once a purchase is complete, automatically creating accounts based on email addresses. This allows user to submit multiple orders under a single email address without registration.

The store can be easily customized through the Django admin panel to add and customize your own products.

Additionally, the app has built-in support for PayPal business accounts and digital products without shipping.

Piraguero is perfect for small businesses or ordering interfaces such as on-site touchscreen menus.

The app is named in honor of the self-starting piragua cart owners of Puerto Rico.
